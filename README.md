# Redis Messaging

## Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a messaging system using Redis, leveraging its various features to facilitate communication between producers and consumers. Redis, originally renowned as an in-memory cache, has evolved into a robust key-value database with messaging capabilities akin to Apache Kafka/Pulsar.
